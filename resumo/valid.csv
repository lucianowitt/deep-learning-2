0	This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .
1	While easier to sit through than most of Jaglom 's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it 's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points .
1	A hit - and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as Cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped .

0	In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .
2	This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter .

1	Illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller .
2	It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .
3	A positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a Shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera .

1	Morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he 's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating .
2	Schneider 's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story 's continuity and progression .
2	Maid in Manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road ... But as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans ' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection .

0	The rest of the film ... is dudsville .
3	As a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , Sex with Strangers is a success .
0	A chiller resolutely without chills .
2	... a story , an old and scary one , about the monsters we make , and the vengeance they take .
2	Saved from being merely way-cool by a basic , credible compassion .
3	There 's a part of us that can not help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something .

2	Gere gives a good performance in a film that does n't merit it .
0	A ` Girls Gone Wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , The Burning Sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that .
1	... stale and uninspired .
4	Thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all .
0	a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome .
3	Despite the surface attractions -- Conrad L. Hall 's cinematography will likely be nominated for an Oscar next year -- there 's something impressive and yet lacking about everything .
2	It 's about time .
2	There are problems with this film that even 3 Oscar winners ca n't overcome , but it 's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling .
0	... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .
3	While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans -LRB- as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics -RRB- , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .
1	Chan 's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .
3	Like Kissing Jessica Stein , Amy 's Orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor .
2	This version moves beyond the original 's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema 's inability to stand in for true , lived experience .
1	As the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , -LRB- Franco -RRB- has all of Dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability .
4	The performances are an absolute joy .
4	It 's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn .
3	Alarms for Duvall 's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks .
3	I was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an American-Russian Armageddon .
1	Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .
2	... best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the Warren Report .
1	The film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what 's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture .
1	Though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted .
3	A quietly moving look back at what it was to be Iranian-American in 1979 .
1	This dreadfully earnest inversion of the Concubine love triangle eschews the previous film 's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .
1	The truth about Charlie is that it 's a brazenly misguided project .
1	If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish .
2	We get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle .
1	The screenplay by James Eric , James Horton and director Peter O'Fallon ... is so pat it makes your teeth hurt .
1	It 's a long way from Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry -LRB- 1984 -RRB- to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation .
2	Put it somewhere between Sling Blade and South of Heaven , West of Hell in the pantheon of Billy Bob 's body of work .
0	Philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .
2	In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .
3	For every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian -LRB- Orlando Jones -RRB- who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized .
1	You do n't need to know your Ice-T 's from your Cool-J 's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of California .
4	The Bard as black comedy -- Willie would have loved it .
2	Directors John Musker and Ron Clements , the team behind The Little Mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they are n't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space .
4	Rarely have I seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart .
4	A terrific B movie -- in fact , the best in recent memory .
3	The first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year !
2	A solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy .
3	The humor and humanity of Monsoon Wedding are in perfect balance .
3	For more than two decades Mr. Nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity .
3	Stevens ' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls .
2	Tom Green and an Ivy League college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like Stealing Harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .
3	The most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from Portugal .
4	More than their unique residences , Home Movie is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it .
2	Norton holds the film together .
3	And the reason for that is a self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence .
4	Stands as one of the year 's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be .
3	Ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer 's memory .
4	An extraordinary dramatic experience .
3	Remove Spider-Man the movie from its red herring surroundings and it 's apparent that this is one summer film that satisfies .
0	The film is all over the place , really .
3	Even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern .
1	Spain 's greatest star wattage does n't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy .
0	The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
1	Too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , Vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work .
2	It may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of Weekend and Two or Three Things I Know About Her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ?
0	Yes , I suppose it 's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but World Traveler gave me no reason to care , so I did n't .
1	Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . '
3	Eyre is on his way to becoming the American Indian Spike Lee .
0	The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .
2	Brown 's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie .
2	About a Boy vividly recalls the Cary Grant of Room for One More , Houseboat and Father Goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him .
3	You will likely prefer to keep on watching .
4	An exceptionally acted , quietly affecting cop drama .
3	An absorbing and unsettling psychological drama .
3	Like all of Egoyan 's work , Ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious .
1	Stress ` dumb . '
2	Weird , vulgar comedy that 's definitely an acquired taste .
3	UB equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of ` black culture ' and the dorkier aspects of ` white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are .
2	Mildly entertaining .
4	It 's immensely ambitious , different than anything that 's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it 's trying to do .
2	Not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending .
0	True to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` The Country Bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation .
1	He fails .
3	Best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events .
1	Feels familiar and tired .
2	Kaufman and Jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing .
3	As the princess , Sorvino glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat .
3	Passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly ...
4	The immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary Space Station 3D .
1	Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any Plympton film : boring .
3	There 's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to Lau .
4	The overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude .

4	If you like quirky , odd movies and\/or the ironic , here 's a fun one .
1	Just is n't as weird as it ought to be .
1	Laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .
3	Amy and Matthew have a bit of a phony relationship , but the film works in spite of it .
4	Australian filmmaker David Flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them .
2	it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like My Big Fat Greek Wedding
0	Haneke 's script -LRB- from Elfriede Jelinek 's novel -RRB- is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .
3	It 's a film that 's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio 's animated classics .
1	Puts on airs of a Hal Hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself .
1	Grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length
0	It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
0	It 's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes Sex With Strangers , which opens today in the New York metropolitan area , so distasteful .
1	Been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called The Professional .
4	A lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family .
3	What makes it worth watching is Quaid 's performance .
1	Sodden and glum , even in those moments where it 's supposed to feel funny and light .
1	While it is interesting to witness the conflict from the Palestinian side , Longley 's film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .
1	A cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial .
3	Seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-Shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil .
1	A dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so .
0	If it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo .
0	Most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .
0	My own minority report is that it stinks .
2	Visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay .
2	The plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story .
0	An awful lot like one of -LRB- Spears ' -RRB- music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .
2	You see Robin Williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm .
1	It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .
2	Whether our action-and-popcorn obsessed culture will embrace this engaging and literate psychodrama is n't much of a mystery , unfortunately .
2	Life or Something Like It has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities .
3	An uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations . '
0	... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .
1	The whole talking-animal thing is grisly .
2	Simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad .
2	For a debut film , Skin of Man , Heart of Beast feels unusually assured .
2	Spare yet audacious ...
3	Two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending .
2	Debate it .
3	The stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble .
3	By turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic .
0	For its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .
3	You may be captivated , as I was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why Paul Thomas Anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which Adam Sandler will probably ever appear .
4	A venturesome , beautifully realized psychological mood piece that reveals its first-time feature director 's understanding of the expressive power of the camera .
3	And educational !
1	Impostor ca n't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies .
0	A devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism .
0	a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
3	It 's incredible the number of stories the Holocaust has generated .
3	Genuinely unnerving .
0	... an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler .
3	The Four Feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .
1	A complete waste of time .
4	A remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic .
4	It 's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother\/daughter pair .
1	You come away thinking not only that Kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .
0	It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .
3	A genuine mind-bender .
1	I could have used my two hours better watching Being John Malkovich again .

1	The movie is a mess from start to finish .
2	Auto Focus is not your standard Hollywood bio-pic .
2	There 's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned , as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate , but generally , it 's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .
3	The concept is a hoot .
0	Unfortunately , it 's also not very good .
4	A graceful , moving tribute to the courage of New York 's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice .
3	Simone is not a bad film .
3	Like a precious and finely cut diamond , magnificent to behold in its sparkling beauty yet in reality it 's one tough rock .
2	Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .
1	The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .
3	A knowing look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor .
0	` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .
1	While not all that bad of a movie , it 's nowhere near as good as the original .
1	Feral and uncomfortable .
3	A headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox Jews on the West Bank , Joseph Cedar 's Time Of Favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation , it does so without compromising that complexity .
0	The movie is a desperate miscalculation .
3	What 's invigorating about it is that it does n't give a damn .
3	The filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , B movie way , they succeed .
2	It 's not life-affirming -- its vulgar and mean , but I liked it .
1	A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .
3	If you can read the subtitles -LRB- the opera is sung in Italian -RRB- and you like ` Masterpiece Theatre ' type costumes , you 'll enjoy this movie .
3	One of the best of a growing strain of daring films ... that argue that any sexual relationship that does n't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect .
0	The Sum of All Fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it 's really nothing more than warmed-over Cold War paranoia .
1	The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .
2	... generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish .
0	The thing just never gets off the ground .
1	The acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the Wal-Mart checkout line .
1	A listless and desultory affair .
4	This sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem .
3	There are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers do n't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies .
1	The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of Bewitched that takes place during Spring Break .
3	A plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of ` home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households .
4	The hard-to-predict and absolutely essential chemistry between the down-to-earth Bullock and the nonchalant Grant proves to be sensational , and everything meshes in this elegant entertainment .
1	A mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke .
4	Demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful , subjective filmmaking .
2	The animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but Jonah ... never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment .
4	The film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer .
1	Paul Cox needed to show it .
3	Soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film .
3	Though it 's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of Evans ' saga of Hollywood excess .
3	Yes , but also intriguing and honorable , a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy .
4	A stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling .
3	Japanese director Shohei Imamura 's latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the sophomoric and the sublime .
2	Clever but not especially compelling .
0	Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized .
3	An encouraging effort from McCrudden
2	Unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , Harvard Man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .
4	Audiard successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling .
4	Intelligent and moving .
3	Malcolm McDowell is cool .
0	As steamy as last week 's pork dumplings .
1	Instead of trying to bust some blondes , -LRB- Diggs -RRB- should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad .
1	Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .
3	Instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , Schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view .
2	Except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made .
2	Only at the prospect of Beck 's next project .
1	Stripped almost entirely of such tools as nudity , profanity and violence , LaBute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection .
2	How I Killed My Father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you 're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts .
0	Shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors ...
2	It 's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from .
1	One of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch .
0	Think The Lion King redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams , the world 's most generic rock star .
1	It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .

3	If you can push on through the slow spots , you 'll be rewarded with some fine acting .

0	This flat run at a hip-hop Tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of Pootie Tang in between its punchlines .
2	Those unfamiliar with Mormon traditions may find The Singles Ward occasionally bewildering .

0	Extremely bad .
3	Precocious smarter-than-thou wayward teen struggles to rebel against his oppressive , right-wing , propriety-obsessed family .
2	A movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action TV series .

1	Love Liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit .
0	Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .

4	` Anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
1	An average B-movie with no aspirations to be anything more .
2	When in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip .
1	I spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits

0	The movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man .
3	Unexpected , and often contradictory , truths emerge .
1	This starts off with a 1950 's Doris Day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast .
4	Texan director George Ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare .
2	Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan 's platinum-blonde hair .
2	Viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some Freudian puppet .
0	Wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time .
2	If you want to see a train wreck that you ca n't look away from , then look no further , because here it is .
1	At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .
1	Who , exactly , is fighting whom here ?
2	It 's Young Guns meets Goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs .
1	The elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat .
4	Scooby Doo is surely everything its fans are hoping it will be , and in that sense is a movie that deserves recommendation .

1	Storytelling feels slight .
3	Becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the Papin sisters .
3	Fast and funny , an action cartoon that 's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd .
3	An oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion .
4	The Emperor 's Club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality .
4	Even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end ... you almost do n't notice the 129-minute running time .
2	Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .
3	Unlike most anime , whose most ardent fans outside Japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes , Metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile .
3	A mischievous visual style and oodles of charm make ` Cherish ' a very good -LRB- but not great -RRB- movie .
1	While this film has an ` A ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .
2	As his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in Long Time Dead says ` I 'm telling you , this is f \*\*\* ed ' .
1	They kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book .
1	One suspects that Craven endorses They simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison .
