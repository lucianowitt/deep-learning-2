0	That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .
4	There is a real subject here , and it is handled with intelligence and care .
2	A serviceable Euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom -- handguns , BMWs and seaside chateaus .
0	... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .
2	You know that ten bucks you 'd spend on a ticket ?
3	With an unusual protagonist -LRB- a kilt-wearing Jackson -RRB- and subject matter , the improbable `` Formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .

4	The film offers an intriguing what-if premise .
3	Other than the slightly flawed -LRB- and fairly unbelievable -RRB- finale , everything else is top shelf .
2	There 's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to .
2	Has its share of arresting images .
1	Like Schindler 's List , The Grey Zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .
3	In painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the Marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song .
1	You may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by Argentine director Fabian Bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet .
2	The strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film .

2	It seems Grant does n't need the floppy hair and the self-deprecating stammers after all .
3	It looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships .
1	The Transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .
3	The film 's highlight is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations .
4	Like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame .
2	Defies logic , the laws of physics and almost anyone 's willingness to believe in it .
3	Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time .
3	Not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered , but the film works well enough to make it worth watching .
4	Jones has tackled a meaty subject and drawn engaging characters while peppering the pages with memorable zingers .
2	Let 's face it -- there are n't many reasons anyone would want to see Crossroads if they 're not big fans of teen pop kitten Britney Spears .
1	Watching Queen of the Damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in .
4	This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .
3	Tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother .
1	A rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children 's television .
3	The movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end .
1	The screenplay does too much meandering , Norton has to recite bland police procedural details , Fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , Hopkins looks like a drag queen .
2	The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .
1	Well-meant but unoriginal .
2	With wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters ' striving solipsism .
2	Strictly middle of the road .
2	Do you chuckle at the thought of an ancient librarian whacking a certain part of a man 's body ?
1	Been there done that .
2	That is because - damn it !
1	The movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .

1	On top of a foundering performance , -LRB- Madonna 's -RRB- denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag .
1	What 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .
3	Not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but Coppola , along with his sister , Sofia , is a real filmmaker .
4	The way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of Gator-bashing are consistently delightful .
1	Could n't someone take Rob Schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ?
2	Wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
2	Less worrying about covering all the drama in Frida 's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .
4	A winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others .
3	The dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen .
1	The only pain you 'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub .
3	Williams absolutely nails Sy 's queasy infatuation and overall strangeness .
2	Watching Spirited Away is like watching an Eastern imagination explode .
4	Birthday Girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked .
0	The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .
0	Even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did n't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by Avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .
1	Average , at best , I 'm afraid .
1	But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
0	You 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why Lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
2	Even more baffling is that it 's funny .
3	Definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the Roman Colosseum .
4	The entire cast is first-rate , especially Sorvino .
2	Just plain silly .
1	Reggio and Glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that Glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .
3	For 95 often hilarious minutes
0	The 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .
4	A coming-of-age movie that Hollywood would n't have the guts to make .
3	Eight Legged Freaks is clever and funny , is amused by its special effects , and leaves you feeling like you 've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer .
1	... a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .
2	A behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world-class fencer and the champion that 's made a difference to NYC inner-city youth .
3	has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a `` 2 '' at the end of its title .
3	Features Fincher 's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity .
1	The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- and no one -RRB- .
1	Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama .
2	She 's not yet an actress , not quite a singer ...
3	more precious than perspicacious
3	The film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from Paul 's perspective .
2	Less about Shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw Quentin Tarantino 's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations .
0	The actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .
3	-LRB- `` Safe Conduct '' -RRB- is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage .
3	Lawrence plumbs personal tragedy and also the human comedy .
3	It 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .
1	An achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses .
1	Told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .
0	Do n't even bother to rent this on video .
4	From a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving French drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .
4	An invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker 's extraordinary access to Massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent .
2	Spider-Man is in the same category as X-Men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around .
2	This is a picture that Maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool .
4	An unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud .
2	This film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers .
3	The charm of Revolution OS is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers .
3	Inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening .
2	Some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the Ball and Chain .
2	Has its moments , but it 's pretty far from a treasure .
2	For all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , Blood Work is a strong , character-oriented piece .
3	Nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin .
1	This rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor .
3	Has a solid emotional impact .
2	the Venezuelans say things like `` si , pretty much '' and `` por favor , go home '' when talking to Americans .
1	You 'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous -LRB- than Leon -RRB- .
4	Definitely worth 95 minutes of your time .
3	-LRB- `` Take Care of My Cat '' -RRB- is an honestly nice little film that takes us on an examination of young adult life in urban South Korea through the hearts and minds of the five principals .
2	Go for La Salle 's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .
3	It 's fun , but it 's a real howler .
1	I 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't .
1	The film does n't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously , it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA .
0	Despite the fact that this film was n't as bad as I thought it was going to be , it 's still not a good movie
2	Post 9\/11 the philosophical message of `` Personal Freedom First '' might not be as palatable as intended .
4	Schnitzler does a fine job contrasting the sleekness of the film 's present with the playful paranoia of the film 's past . '
1	The movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .
0	An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .
3	Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .
1	preachy and
3	While it may not add up to the sum of its parts , Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .
3	Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
1	But they do n't fit well together and neither is well told .
1	As a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character .
4	The gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon .
1	An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .
3	Sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group .
4	The first Tunisian film I have ever seen , and it 's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment I 'm likely to see all year .
4	The storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome .
4	An intelligently made -LRB- and beautifully edited -RRB- picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the Hollywood pipeline without a hitch .
1	So mind-numbingly awful that you hope Britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned .
3	I liked the movie , but I know I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further .
2	` Hey Arnold ! '
2	Hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast .
3	Manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state .
1	... contains very few laughs and even less surprises .
1	Could as easily have been called ` Under Siege 3 : In Alcatraz ' ... a cinematic corpse that never springs to life .
0	The Country Bears wastes an exceptionally good idea .
1	Feeble comedy .
1	The modern remake of Dumas 's story is long on narrative and -LRB- too -RRB- short on action .
1	Resembles a soft porn Brian De Palma pastiche .
2	The cast has a high time , but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .
3	It finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice .
4	Twenty years after its first release , E.T. remains the most wondrous of all Hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of Steven Spielberg 's misunderstood career .
1	A non-mystery mystery .
0	Confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when I have to put up with 146 minutes of it .
3	Watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown .
3	It is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad .
3	Writer\/director Burr Steers emphasizes the Q in Quirky , with mixed results .
2	Holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp .
3	It 's sweet .
1	We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .
1	Unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .
3	This is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a Friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn .
3	Fierce , glaring and unforgettable .
1	That 's because relatively nothing happens .
0	Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .
0	-LRB- A -RRB- soulless , stupid sequel ...
1	A good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground .
3	She boxes these women 's souls right open for us .
0	or maybe `` How will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of The Rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? ''
0	Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .
2	Far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love .
1	It is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished .
3	This movie has the usual impossible stunts ... But it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie .
1	Sometimes makes less sense than the Bruckheimeresque American action flicks it emulates .
3	An incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks .
1	... while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey does n't really go anywhere .
1	I can imagine this movie as a b & w British comedy , circa 1960 , with Peter Sellers , Kenneth Williams , et al. , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless .
4	A movie I loved on first sight and , even more important , love in remembrance .
3	We want the funk - and this movie 's got it .
1	A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .
4	Fifty years after the fact , the world 's political situation seems little different , and -LRB- director Phillip -RRB- Noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill .
4	-LRB- Breheny 's -RRB- lensing of the New Zealand and Cook Island locations captures both the beauty of the land and the people .
3	The wonderfully lush Morvern Callar is pure punk existentialism , and Ms. Ramsay and her co-writer , Liana Dognini , have dramatized the Alan Warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to Irvine Welsh 's book Trainspotting .
0	It 's as if a bored Cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` Got AIDS yet ? ''
1	Something has been lost in the translation ... another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .
2	Muddled , trashy and incompetent
4	Kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor .
0	Tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of Animal House but instead comes closer to the failure of the third Revenge of the Nerds sequel .
3	Though Lan Yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency , the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude .
1	Looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of Scarface or Carlito 's Way .
0	-LRB- Sam 's -RRB- self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining .
1	I did n't laugh .
1	A supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama .
3	An intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality .
2	Suffice to say that after seeing this movie in IMAX form , you 'll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of Tom Hanks ' face than his wife is .
4	Remarkable for its excellent storytelling , its economical , compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity , it 's an adventure story and history lesson all in one .
4	The best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and Bertrand Tavernier 's oft-brilliant Safe Conduct -LRB- `` Laissez-passer '' -RRB- wears its heart on its sleeve .
1	But for the most part , The Weight of Water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness .
0	A bad movie that happened to good actors .
4	That 's fun for kids of any age .
0	A film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters .
2	Blade II is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she 's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time .
0	Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents
0	Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
3	It is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity .
3	It 's the filmmakers ' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time B movies good-bad that makes Eight Legged Freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion .
1	An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .
1	No , I do n't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .
0	The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .
3	The work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way .
0	Vulgar is too optimistic a title .
2	While this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that 's more interested in asking questions than in answering them .
2	... creates a visceral sense of its characters ' lives and conflicted emotions that carries it far above ... what could have been a melodramatic , Lifetime Channel-style anthology .
0	What more can be expected from a college comedy that 's target audience has n't graduated from junior high school ?
3	Woven together handsomely , recalling sixties ' rockumentary milestones from Lonely Boy to Do n't Look Back .
2	Confounding because it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis .
1	The results are far more alienating than involving .
4	`` Frailty '' starts out like a typical Bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different -LRB- and better -RRB- than most films with this theme .
2	Arnold !
1	Ill-considered , unholy hokum .

0	An awful snooze .
4	The overall fabric is hypnotic , and Mr. Mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy .
2	Merci pour le movie .
0	What we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .
1	Normally , Rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .
3	Both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter .
1	To be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .
2	Helps to remind the First World that HIV\/AIDS is far from being yesterday 's news .

1	Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on .

1	This is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout .
1	Its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock -LRB- since Sept. 11 -RRB- .
3	In the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .
4	This fascinating look at Israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from Gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful .
3	Mark Pellington 's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth .

3	What 's most memorable about Circuit is that it 's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables Shafer to navigate spaces both large ... and small ... with considerable aplomb .

1	The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
0	Done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment .
2	Certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic .

2	As self-aware movies go , Who is Cletis Tout ?

4	Brian Tufano 's handsome widescreen photography and Paul Grabowsky 's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special .

0	Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .
2	At the end of the movie , my 6-year-old nephew said , `` I guess I come from a broken family , and my uncles are all aliens , too . ''
3	Visually fascinating ... an often intense character study about fathers and sons , loyalty and duty .

1	A reworking of Die Hard and Cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either .

2	Despite Hoffman 's best efforts , Wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before .
4	Spectacularly beautiful , not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing .
1	-LRB- Janey -RRB- forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies .

4	It 's a fun adventure movie for kids -LRB- of all ages -RRB- that like adventure .
2	But you 'd never guess that from the performances .

4	Morton deserves an Oscar nomination .
2	It just does n't have much else ... especially in a moral sense .
1	The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense .

4	A burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at .
1	Shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was .
4	All three actresses are simply dazzling , particularly Balk , who 's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents .
0	An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .
3	But the actors make this worth a peek .
4	Eric Schweig and Graham Greene both exude an air of dignity that 's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters .

3	This time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it 's still a rollicking good time for the most part .
2	Unfortunately , neither Sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate .
4	Tully is in many ways the perfect festival film : a calm , self-assured portrait of small town regret , love , duty and friendship that appeals to the storytelling instincts of a slightly more literate filmgoing audience .
1	What little grace -LRB- Rifkin 's -RRB- tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics .

0	There 's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits .
1	Simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn .
2	Dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery .
4	It leaves little doubt that Kidman has become one of our best actors .
4	The film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side .
3	Maybe it is formula filmmaking , but there 's nothing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted and this one is .
1	Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .
3	Crudup 's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families .

2	The Armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment .
4	Visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it 's the very definition of epic adventure .
1	And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .
0	And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
3	This breezy caper movie becomes a soulful , incisive meditation on the way we were , and the way we are .
2	What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears ' first movie .
4	An example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship .
4	This method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here .
2	Twist open the Ouzo !
4	The Son Of The Bride 's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues .

1	It 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by Scott Kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .
4	The most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any `` Jackass '' fan could want .
4	A gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost .
3	A weird , arresting little ride .
1	-LRB- Denis ' -RRB- bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product .
4	The best thing I can say about this film is that I ca n't wait to see what the director does next .
1	But there 's plenty to offend everyone ...
2	The path Ice Age follows most closely , though , is the one established by Warner Bros. giant Chuck Jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie 's release .
3	Nicole Kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that Birthday Girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while .
2	Made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because -LRB- Solondz 's -RRB- cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt .
3	The film 's plot may be shallow , but you 've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots .
3	Worth seeing just for Weaver and LaPaglia .

3	A compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one .
3	An awfully good , achingly human picture .
4	The writing is clever and the cast is appealing .
1	There is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us .
4	A captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age .
1	It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
4	That Jack Nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend .
3	Dogtown & Z-Boys evokes the blithe rebel fantasy with the kind of insouciance embedded in the sexy demise of James Dean .
1	-LRB- The kid 's -RRB- just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .
1	... the good and different idea -LRB- of middle-aged romance -RRB- is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` Never Again . ''
4	Hardly an objective documentary , but it 's great cinematic polemic ... love Moore or loathe him , you 've got to admire ... the intensity with which he 's willing to express his convictions .
3	A penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination .
3	An intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time .
1	One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing .

1	But even then , I 'd recommend waiting for DVD and just skipping straight to her scenes .
3	Ken Russell would love this .

3	You watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises .
3	A good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold .
1	To the filmmakers , Ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .
1	The pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro in Showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .
3	Rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle
1	It 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .
1	Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .
3	Interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of Carmen
2	There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .
3	Though Jones and Snipes are enthralling
1	Wewannour money back , actually .
0	Spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
2	The directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
2	So riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along .
3	What makes the movie special is its utter sincerity .
0	The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
3	Leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that 's simultaneously painful and refreshing .
2	It 's a brilliant , honest performance by Nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic Kathy Bates turns up .
0	It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .
1	It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .
3	Peter Jackson has done the nearly impossible .
0	Stale and
3	A movie that will thrill you , touch you and make you laugh as well .
4	Ben Kingsley is truly funny , playing a kind of Ghandi gone bad .
3	While the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .
3	Just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over .
2	Narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself .
2	National Lampoon 's Van Wilder may aim to be the next Animal House , but it more closely resembles this year 's version of Tomcats .
4	Mike Leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life
1	... hokey art house pretension .
3	As immaculate as Stuart Little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous .
1	Unless you 're a fanatic , the best advice is : ` Scooby ' do n't .
1	Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but Kaufman and Gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go .
1	What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?
1	As is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , Mr. Murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold .
1	It 's a Frankenstein-monster of a film that does n't know what it wants to be .
2	If you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , Sweet Home Alabama is diverting in the manner of Jeff Foxworthy 's stand-up act .
3	It 's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it .
0	Boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .
3	A tasty masala .
3	It 's definitely an improvement on the first Blade , since it does n't take itself so deadly seriously .
4	Like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely .
2	Deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits .
4	Refreshing .
1	Although ... visually striking and slickly staged , it 's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated .
0	As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .
3	This film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent , deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion .
1	An imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .
4	Bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness .
1	plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood .
1	While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs -LRB- including a knockout of a closing line -RRB- , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .
1	For a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .
2	Even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , East-vs .
2	It 's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process .
2	What Eric Schaeffer has accomplished with Never Again may not , strictly speaking , qualify as revolutionary .
4	Both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes .
2	To show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .
2	The talk-heavy film plays like one of Robert Altman 's lesser works .
3	A deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession -- one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom .
0	After you laugh once -LRB- maybe twice -RRB- , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot .
0	The problem with ANTWONE FISHER is that it has a screenplay written by Antwone Fisher based on the book by Antwone Fisher .
3	Brown Sugar signals director Rick Famuyiwa 's emergence as an articulate , grown-up voice in African-American cinema .
1	Squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , Burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .
1	An uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .
3	Shiner can certainly go the distance , but is n't world championship material
2	While Van Wilder may not be the worst National Lampoon film , it 's far from being this generation 's Animal House .
1	What goes on for the 110 minutes of `` Panic Room '' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .
3	A bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale .
1	While some will object to the idea of a Vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , Soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation .
3	Although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , Dogtown and Z-Boys has a compelling story to tell .
2	Smothered by its own solemnity .
0	A sentimental mess that never rings true .
4	There are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away .
2	A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale .
1	Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .
1	Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
3	Strange occurrences build in the mind of the viewer and take on extreme urgency .
3	Though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there 's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting .
2	` Sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates .
1	Sadly , Full Frontal plays like the work of a dilettante .
3	In its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , Time Out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything I have seen in an American film .
2	The biggest problem with this movie is that it 's not nearly long enough .
3	` Possession , ' based on the book by A.S. Byatt , demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
0	A real snooze .
1	I wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .
2	Smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong ... it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera .
3	Kiarostami has crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope .
1	Are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of Clue ?
3	`` Extreme Ops '' exceeds expectations .
4	The fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels
0	It looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such .
2	This is amusing for about three minutes .
2	... Jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just is n't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead 's specific gifts .
2	Basically , it 's pretty but dumb .
4	This is one of the year 's best films .
1	A movie that harps on media-constructed ` issues ' like whether compromise is the death of self ... this Orgasm -LRB- wo n't be an -RRB- exceedingly memorable one for most people .
3	K-19 : The Widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining .
3	The sentimental cliches mar an otherwise excellent film .
2	-LRB- Crystal and De Niro -RRB- manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing .
1	Has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness .
0	Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .
4	The most ingenious film comedy since Being John Malkovich .
4	Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby !
2	My Wife 's plotting is nothing special ; it 's the delivery that matters here .
1	Too intensely focused on the travails of being Hal Hartley to function as pastiche , No Such Thing is Hartley 's least accessible screed yet .
2	A very pretty after-school special .
1	A non-Britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine .
3	Promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents ' anguish .
3	Moonlight Mile does n't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy .
4	It 's no lie -- Big Fat Liar is a real charmer .
4	On that score , the film certainly does n't disappoint .
4	His work with actors is particularly impressive .
4	A straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they 've rarely been given .
0	With the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which They is n't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .
0	What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .
3	Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .
3	And yet , it still works .
2	Interesting , but not compelling .
1	An excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay .
4	Piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling .
3	The casting of von Sydow ... is itself Intacto 's luckiest stroke .
1	Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .
1	The plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution .
3	The movie enters a realm where few non-porn films venture , and comes across as darkly funny , energetic , and surprisingly gentle .
3	This amiable picture talks tough , but it 's all bluster -- in the end it 's as sweet as Greenfingers ...
3	There are n't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs. the big guys .
3	Downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message .
0	Deep down , I realized the harsh reality of my situation : I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered .
4	Even if you 've seen `` Stomp '' -LRB- the stage show -RRB- , you still have to see this !
1	Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .
1	All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .
2	Proves mainly that South Korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their Hollywood counterparts .
1	Lacking substance and soul , Crossroads comes up shorter than Britney 's cutoffs .
3	Real Women Have Curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by Ferrera and Ontiveros .
3	Both Grant and Hoult carry the movie because they are believable as people -- flawed , assured of the wrong things , and scared to admit how much they may really need the company of others .
4	This documentary is a dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder of what -LRB- Evans -RRB- had , lost , and got back .
2	The film sometimes flags ... but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk , amusing pace .
3	A pleasing , often-funny comedy .
2	Grown-up quibbles are beside the point here .
3	As each of them searches for their place in the world , Miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity .

4	This is pure , exciting moviemaking .
1	Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , -LRB- Ahola -RRB- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation .
4	Ong 's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent Chinese immigrant 's experiences in New York City .
2	The message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another .
2	Freundlich 's made -LRB- Crudup -RRB- a suburban architect , and a cipher .
1	After all , it 'll probably be in video stores by Christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies .
0	The comedy is nonexistent .
4	A new film from Bill Plympton , the animation master , is always welcome .

2	There 's very little sense to what 's going on here , but the makers serve up the cliches with considerable dash .
2	No big hairy deal .
1	It 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar American style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .
2	At its best ... Festival in Cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in Cannes .
0	Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago .
3	If you 're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you 're at the right film .
1	It 's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long .
0	Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
3	Indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost Dadaist proportions .
1	Fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references .
3	Hugh Grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .
0	Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .
1	This romantic\/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .
1	Did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ?
0	At the one-hour mark , Herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion .
1	Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz , rather than a fully developed story .
2	Now I can see why people thought I was too hard on `` The Mothman Prophecies '' .
3	It excels because , unlike so many other Hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope .
1	Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .
3	You never know where Changing Lanes is going to take you but it 's a heck of a ride .
3	I could n't recommend this film more .
1	One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .
1	Hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script .
2	An overwrought Taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship .
3	A college story that works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing !
2	Egoyan 's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose .
0	Slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth .
4	A vibrant , colorful , semimusical rendition .
3	The cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story .
0	For a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new Hal Hartley movie to pore over , No Such Thing is a big letdown .
3	Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .
2	Though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , Jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set .
1	About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .
